===COMPILING===

compile using make. this creates a file called driver

eg: make


===RUNNING THE PROGRAM===

run the using the name of the compiled program and the number of the subdivisions you want 

eg: ./driver 10

if you don't give it any number it defaults to four.

eg: ./driver 

putting in a number less than 2 will not work (quits the program)

eg: ./driver 1 //DON'T DO

===RESULT DELIVERY===

results are delivered to the screen, first we show gaussian elimination and then we show QR decomposition.

The format by showing the point being compared, the real value of that point, the approximate solution at that point, and the relative error from that approximation. 

eg: Point (0.25, 0.25): Real Value = 0.9960 Approximation = 0.9960 Relative Error = 0.0000
